CSS:

Pagelayout- 

margin,borders, padding add to the content window of the browser
	*browsers have non zero values automatically*
	*can reset all browser values to 0 with browser reset*

**These are all called Declarations**

hiding elements:

	visibility: hidden [hides element but leaves space it creates]

	
	display: none [hides content and removes space it creates]
		 inline
		 block

margin = auto [centers on pg]

position: fixed [elements stay in fixed position]
z-index: 12 [assign numbers, highest number is on the top, direction coming 						out from the screen toward viewer]

clear: both; [ex. value]
 	[prevents elements from wrapping around other elements]

float: left; 
float: right; 
float: center;
	[makes element float to whichever direction specifined]


Javascript: [goes in html doc.]
	    [can change html content, attributes, styles(css), validate data]
	    [based on C, JS is a scritping language, everthing is dynamic]
	    [Interpreted language, interpreted and executed line by line as it 								goes down]
*JavaScript can be placed in the <body> and the <head> sections of an HTML page*
*JavaScript can be placed in the <body> and the <head> sections of an HTML page*

static [language is compiled, advantage: code is checked before it is ran]

script should be last thing in html
Browser runs files from top to bottom
Put script as last thing in the body

	<body>
		<script src="TemplateJS.js"></script>
	</body>



Immediately Invoked Function Expression [IIFE]


JS template to use/memorize
(function () {
	"use strict";
	
      var main = function () {
	console.log{'hello world');
};
	$(document).ready(function () { [loads document then runs functions]
	main();
	});
}()};

[prints hello world with js]

[function declaration] (function() {
				    
			            .
				    .
				    .

				}()); <--parens call the function immediately

control+shift+j [brings up browser console]
		[look in console if js errors occur]

<http://code.jquery.com/jquery-.2.2.0

getElementById() [finds hmtl element based on id name]

Types:
	numeric type 
	string type
	array type
	object type
	no boolean type: so no true or false statements
	function type

Control structures:
			if 
			while
			for

Comparison opperators:
			>[greater than], <[less thans]
			==, === [looks for same values and same type]
			!=[not equal], !==[not equal]
			
			[all the same in js] ex. 8==8
			    			 8==8.0
			    			 8=="8"
		            			 8=='8'

					    ex. !(8==="8")
					    ex. 8!=="8"

Boolean operators:

			&& [ands], ||[ors]

= [assign operator]

In js: variables have to be declared
		var [declares variable]
		
			ex. var a;
			    a = 4;
			    a = "bob";

anything other than 0 = true
zero values = false

truthy: nonzero, string
falsey: 0, "", undefined

ex.
	var a = 3;
	if (a) 
		[interpreted as true bc var a is a nonzero value]


if statement:

		if () {

		   }
		   else {

		  }

First Class Datatype: [Functions in js are first class datatypes]

		1. Can be named
		2. can be passed as an argument
		3. can be returned as a value from a function

	var main = function() {
		console.log("hello world"); [first class datatype ex]
			}
		alternately
	
	function main() {
		
		}

		main(); [invokes main]

Java: everything is an object or its primitive
JS: do not have to have objects

Method: refers to the behavior of an object
